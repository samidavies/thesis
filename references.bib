This solution is used to solve the resource conflicts during the scheduling phase on m processors. A mechanism for UET–UCT tasks systems is first presented and analyzed. Then a rather unusual feature is introduced to handle SCT task systems: a processor may remain idle even if some tasks are feasible in order to wait for a more important task. The schedule generated by this algorithm is proved to have an overall worst-case performance 1+(1−1/m)α. If the best-known ratio α=43 is used it induces a worst-case performance bounded by 73−4/m for our algorithm."

abstract = "A set of unit-time tasks has to be processed on identical parallel processors subject to precedence constraints and unit-time communication delays; does there exist a schedule of length at most d? The problem has two variants, depending on whether the number of processors is restrictively small or not. For the first variant the question can be answered in polynomial time for d = 3 and is NP-complete for d = 4. The second variant is solvable in polynomial time for d = 5 and NP-complete for d = 6. As a consequence, neither of the corresponding optimization problems has a polynomial approximation scheme, unless P = NP.",

Our algorithm constructs an optimum schedule which uses at most n processors. We furthermore show lower bound results on the amount of recomputation needed, thus answering an open question posed by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis. In addition, precise lower bounds are demonstrated for the scheduling time of full binary trees. Our techniques may contribute to an important new understanding of parallel scheduling when the message delay is significant, which is usually the case."

We show that there is no hope of finding a ρ-approximation with ρ<1+1/(c+4) for minimization of the makespan (resp. 1+1/(2c+5) for total job completion time minimization) (unless P=NP) for the case where all the tasks of the precedence graph have unit execution times, where the multiprocessor is composed of an unrestricted number of machines, and where c denotes the communication delay between two tasks i and j submitted to a precedence constraint and to be processed by two different machines. The problem becomes polynomial whenever the makespan is at most (c+1). The (c+2) case is still partially open. Moreover, we both define and study a new scheduling approximation to schedule unitary tasks in the presence of large communication delays. We provide a polynomial-time approximation algorithm with performance ratio 2(c+1)3 with c≥2."

abstract="This article is concerned with the problem of scheduling a parallel application depicted by a precedence graph in presence of large communication delays. The target architecture is constituted of a bounded number m of identical processors linked together by an interconnection network. Communication delays represent the time of data transfer between two tasks of the application allocated to different processors. Our objective is to find an allocation of tasks to the processors and an execution order on each machine such that the overall completion time is minimized. We consider the special case of unit execution time for all computation tasks and a uniform communication delay $\rho$. We present a new approach based on the reduction of the problem to the successive schedulings of ``small graphs'', roughly speaking graphs which can be scheduled in time at most $\rho$ + 1 on an unbounded number of processors. Allowing duplication, corresponding to the recomputation of some of the tasks, this technique allows us to derive an asymptotic {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}O{\}}{\$}{\$}(ln $\rho$/ ln ln $\rho$)-approximation algorithm for general precedence graph structure.",
